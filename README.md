# Your local chatbot Mac companion

![](Screenshots/iPhone/02-Question1.PNG)

QuBot is a friendly and helpful local chatbot assistant designed specifically for Mac users.

Unlike other chatbots that rely on external servers or internet connectivity, QuBot runs entirely locally on your Mac. This means local responses, improved privacy, and reduced dependence on the internet.
Whether you need assistance with simple tasks, bounce ideas, or just want to engage in friendly conversation, QuBot is here to help.

**NOTE** Line any other Large Language Model, it could provide innacurrate/misleading information. It uses mistral-7B language model as its baseline
